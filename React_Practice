what is Component in ReactJS
============================
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

--> Components are typically used to represent UI elements, such as buttons, inputs, and headers.
--> Components are defined using the function or class keyword.
--> When a component is rendered, it returns a JavaScript object that represents the UI element
--> Components can also have state. State is mutable, which means that it can be changed by the component itself.
    This makes it easy to create dynamic UIs.
