What is ReactJS
===============

React is a open source Java Script library which is used for building user interfaces (Web/Mobile).

ReactJS is for Web and ReactNative is for Mobile applications.

ReactJS existed in 2012, developed by facebook.

official website
================
https://react.dev/

What is the use of ReactJS
==========================

ReactJS is used for developing the Single page applications and PWA(Progressive Web applications)

Advantages/Featuers of React
============================
1. SPA's[Single page Applications]
2. Components 
3. Jsx [Js xml] (we can write html code inside js file)
4. one way data binding
5. Virtual Dom

what is Component in ReactJS
============================
Component is like a function that returns HTML elements.

--> Components are typically used to represent UI elements, such as buttons, inputs, and headers.
--> Components are defined using the function or class keyword.
--> When a component is rendered, it returns a JavaScript object that represents the UI element
--> Components can also have state. State is mutable, which means that it can be changed by the component itself.
    This makes it easy to create dynamic UIs.

--> If one Component B inside another component A, then A is the Parent component and B is the child compoenet of A.

--> Component name must starts with Uppercase and inside return only one block element should mention.

--> <></>, these are called fragemnts used to wrap up code without any impact of styling.

JavaScript XML
==============
In react, we can write html inside javascript called as JSX syntax

Syntax:
-------
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <p>This is a React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

---> JSX is a powerful tool that can make it easier to write React components. However, it is not required to use JSX in React. 

You can also write React components using plain JavaScript.

Syntax
------
const MyComponent = () => {
  return React.createElement('div', null, [
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!'),
    React.createElement('p', null, 'This is a React component.'),
  ]);
};

 --> With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
     syntax: const jsxElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>; 

what is one way data binding in React
=====================================
React uses one way data binding means if the data modifide at one place then it may show the reflection in another place but
another place modified then it will not show the reflection here.

[Angular uses two way data binding means if the data modifide at one place then change will reflect in another place
and if data modified at another place then change will reflect here also]

What is Virtual DOM in React
============================
React will create a Virtual DOM, it is a copy of an actual DOM.
React will compare Virtual DOM with Actual DOM then will render the component where ever the changes happend.


React App folder Struture
=========================
1. node_modules folder
2. .gitignore file
3. package.json file
4. package-lock.json file
5. README file
6. .eslintrc file

what is node_modules
====================
 All the packages which are installed using npm, those will be stored inside node_modules folder in react app

what is .gitignore file
=======================
Whatever the files/folders which are mentioned inside gitignore file those will be ignored while pushing changes into git.

what is package.json file
=========================
package.json file contains meta data about application means what are the packages are used and their versions and etc.

what is package-lock.json
=========================
It is same like package.json file but it contains detailed explanations about dependenceis like from where packages got downloaded and how it get integarted and etc.

what is README.md file
======================
README.md is an instruction manual to how to do your project.

what is .eslintrc file
======================
This file is used for testing purpose.
Whenever your code has an erros then this file will tell you about errors.

Ways to create React app
========================
1. npm install create-react-app
   create-react-app appname
2. npx create-react-app appname
3. npm create vite@latest

what is PropTypes in React
===========================
PropTypes are used to check the which types of properties are coming from parent component.
