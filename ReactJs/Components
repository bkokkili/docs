React Components
================

Components are building blocks of react.

In react, we have two types of componenst.
One is functional components and other one is class components.
Till react 16, we used to have an class components - class components have a state and functional components don't.
React 16 brings hooks so using them we can bring state to functional components also.


Class Components by default have state Object.

Class Component Life Cycle Methods
============================
There are some default methods which will be triggered in different stages of component life cycle, those are called as
Life Cycle Methods.

initialize ==>
    Mounting (started and rendered in DOM) ==>
      updating (re render) ==> 
         unmounting (it is removed from DOM)
