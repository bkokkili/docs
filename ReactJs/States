Reat States
===========
React State is a JavaScript Object that stores data specific to Component.
The data in state object can change over a time, and when it does, React will re-render the 
component with updated data.

In React, a State object can be updated using setState() method.

setState() method takes a single parameter and expects an object which should contain the set of values to be updated.

Once the update is done then that method implicitly calls the render() method to reload the component.

Example
=======
 const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 here defualt value of count is 0
 useState() will have two things, one is vlaue(count) and another one is function(setCount) which is used to update the value.

 Class Components by default have state Object.
 Functional components from  16.2 versions acheive state using by hook "useState".
